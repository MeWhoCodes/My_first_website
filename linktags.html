<p id="sec1">1.Chapter: The hell</p>


<pre>
Sitting on the sofa, drowning in the desolation,
i started sipping water, in my isolation
But then a idea struck me, causing fluctuations
which ulimately led me to my own cremation

After my death,i had to go to hell alone
nothing was left of me, leaving only the bone
So i hobbled to hell all the way from home
But it left me with nothing but a little scorn

I am a awkward man was what i wanted to say,
cause i was too happy to see the lava bay
"To hell, to hell" i sang all the way
So let me be clear with this, if i can have a say?

Different types of toture are there which are absurd
but they have the freedom of which one they preferrered
The blood caked their eyes making everything blurred!
so they couldn't see the misery and pain of others!</pre>

<p id="sec2">2.Chapter: Mr.D</p>
<pre>
Look look look what Mr. D have done.
He did a crime, which he thought was fun!
But all it took was a single police call,
And that was enough to bring Mr D's fall.

From home he was hauled to police station,
Cuffs and clothes caused him suffocation.
The case was opened and opened was his file,
But his face still had the golden smile

Soon the trials began, he was urged to speak
"I am THE Mr. D, i live on the Korvji Peak-
and I broke the law, yes that's what i did-"
But then the head judge stopped him in the mid.

"We know you broke the law but what did you do?
And why are you smikring, why don't you rue?"
But Mr. D refused to speak and lowered his head,
As none knew the crime, so not a word was said

For time-being, he was escored to the Butaold
A prison which also housed all the smuggled golden
Mr. D was thrown in the most secure cell
Cause the Butalold was like incarnation of hell

Soon police set to find what Mr.D had committed
No stones were unturned and nothing was ommited
But still no victim, nothing stolen was found
And no one was killed all was safe and sound

So the police went to Korvji, checked every face
As that's where it said where crime took place
But neighbours said they hadn't called the police
So the Judge signed one word, which said "Release"

Next day Mr.D was released, his cell was empty
The headlines read, "Butaold's gold cell: Empty!!"
All the smuggled gold of Butaold was now gone
and all thats left on everyone's face was a frown

<p id="sec2">3.Chapter: Four Stones</p>
<pre>
Colourful stones, black, brown, white and red!
All sat bickering, and then black one said,
"Well I am a coal, selling me earns a bread,
but who are you, what about you Mr. Fred?"

Now Mr. Fred was the little brownly one,
who was till now sitting quietly in the sun,
"I AM A LIMESTONE! don't you dare make my fun!
buildings are made of me, thus i help world run."

Then up spoke Ms.Ralph, she was white and fat
"I am a perl, my home was the collar of cat
But the cat dropped me while chasing a big rat!
and thus i ended up here, with the lot of you to chat."

"Ha Ha Ha, you all are bunch of cheap lot,
I am a ruby, my worth is a gold filled pot.
You all are worthless, so go somewhere and rot!"
Said the red ruby, who was a snot.

From the nearby building, a hammer was dropped,
It shattered the ruby, the ranting was stopped.
The red glistening powder was swept and mopped,
But nobody whimpered and nobody sobbed.

The new colourful trio, black brown and white
they all sat bickering, starting another fight!
We could wait further and get some more insight
But the poem has to have a end, am i right?
