<p id="sec1">1.Chapter: The hell</p>


<pre>
Sitting on the sofa, drowning in the desolation,
i started sipping water, in my isolation
But then a idea struck me, causing fluctuations
which ulimately led me to my own cremation

After my death,i had to go to hell alone
nothing was left of me, leaving only the bone
So i hobbled to hell all the way from home
But it left me with nothing but a little scorn

I am a awkward man was what i wanted to say,
cause i was too happy to see the lava bay
"To hell, to hell" i sang all the way
So let me be clear with this, if i can have a say?

Different types of toture are there which are absurd
but they have the freedom of which one they preferrered
The blood caked their eyes making everything blurred!
so they couldn't see the misery and pain of others!</pre>

<p id="sec2">2.Chapter: Mr.D</p>
<pre>
Look look look what Mr. D have done.
He did a crime, which he thought was fun!
But all it took was a single police call,
And that was enough to bring Mr D's fall.

From home he was hauled to police station,
Cuffs and clothes caused him suffocation.
The case was opened and opened was his file,
But his face still had the golden smile

Soon the trials began, he was urged to speak
"I am THE Mr. D, i live on the Korvji Peak-
and I broke the law, yes that's what i did-"
But then the head judge stopped him in the mid.

"We know you broke the law but what did you do?
And why are you smikring, why don't you rue?"
But Mr. D refused to speak and lowered his head,
As none knew the crime, so not a word was said

For time-being, he was escored to the Butaold
A prison which also housed all the smuggled golden
Mr. D was thrown in the most secure cell
Cause the Butalold was like incarnation of hell

Soon police set to find what Mr.D had committed
No stones were unturned and nothing was ommited
But still no victim, nothing stolen was found
And no one was killed all was safe and sound

So the police went to Korvji, checked every face
As that's where it said where crime took place
But neighbours said they hadn't called the police
So the Judge signed one word, which said "Release"

Next day Mr.D was released, his cell was empty
The headlines read, "Butaold's gold cell: Empty!!"
All the smuggled gold of Butaold was now gone
and all thats left on everyone's face was a frown

<p id="sec3">3.Chapter: Four Stones</p>
<pre>
Colourful stones, black, brown, white and red!
All sat bickering, and then black one said,
"Well I am a coal, selling me earns a bread,
but who are you, what about you Mr. Fred?"

Now Mr. Fred was the little brownly one,
who was till now sitting quietly in the sun,
"I AM A LIMESTONE! don't you dare make my fun!
buildings are made of me, thus i help world run."

Then up spoke Ms.Ralph, she was white and fat
"I am a perl, my home was the collar of cat
But the cat dropped me while chasing a big rat!
and thus i ended up here, with the lot of you to chat."

"Ha Ha Ha, you all are bunch of cheap lot,
I am a ruby, my worth is a gold filled pot.
You all are worthless, so go somewhere and rot!"
Said the red ruby, who was a snot.

From the nearby building, a hammer was dropped,
It shattered the ruby, the ranting was stopped.
The red glistening powder was swept and mopped,
But nobody whimpered and nobody sobbed.

The new colourful trio, black brown and white
they all sat bickering, starting another fight!
We could wait further and get some more insight
But the poem has to have a end, am i right?

<p id="sec4">4. The Great King Shibi</p>
<pre>
Once there lived a king, Shibi. He was just and powerful but the only problem was that he was foolish. One day his minister
informed him that a poor woman and her child were dying of hunger. The king decided to visit the woman, upon reaching he saw
that the woman was sleeping and her child was eating mud. “Eating mud? Shibi wants to know why this child is eating mud!” said
the great Shibi. One of the ministers replied, “King Shibi, the child has nothing to eat, he is starving sire!” King Shibi was
as foolish as great he was, therefore he didn’t knew what starving was. “Minister! What is starving?”asked Shibi to one of his
minister, “O great Shibi, starving is the most wonderful thing that can happen to oneself “ said the minister in sarcasm. But
Shibi didn’t knew what  sarcasm was, for he was as foolish as great he was. “Oh! Even a poor child is starving while I am not
able to feel this pleasure of so-called ‘starving’, I think I will also starve” he muttered. “Minister! How do we starve” he
enquired. One of the ministers replied “Sir, to starve, we should first donate all our property to the poor…” “Ministers,
distribute all my property to the poor, now!” ordered Shibi. “...then” continued the minister, “we have to donate our regular
clothes and wear ragged clothes…” suddenly the king started to undress and gave all his clothes to the poor son and his mother
and instead wore the shawl the child was wearing. “Then…” gulped the minister fearing the king would kill him, “you have to step
down the thorn and make a new king”. Shibi almost immediately, without a second thought announced, “I Shibi, make this poor
child and his poor mother the next ruler of this kingdom”. The greedy ministers all became happy that they would be able to
share the treasure the king had donated. But suddenly, the earth shook and lord vishnu came out and in one step crushed all the
greedy ministers for trying to inflict pain on king Shibi, then he said “King Shibi, you shall live forever in my eternal place
and this kingdom shall flourish”. The poor son and the poor woman ruled the kingdom henceforth and king Shibi lived peacefully
in Vishnu’s abode, for he was as kind hearted as foolish he was.

<p id="sec5">5. On That Dark Night</p>
<pre>
It was a dark and gloomy night, I was returning from my office. The road lights were flickering and there was nobody on the
road. It was very late for traveling alone. Although I was in a jolly mood, as it was my birthday, I was getting an uncanny
feeling as if something was not right. I noticed that a group of people were  following me, they had black masks, goggles, they
even wore black robes. They walked relatively faster than me, so eventually they were walking beside me. I watched them from the
corner of my eye so that they couldn't notice me seeing them. Their presumed leader, who was leading the group, had something in
his pocket, something heavy. I was horror struck, it was a gun, the leader was carrying a gun. I leapt on the leader, at least I
could  tackle  him, but it seemed to me as if he was ready for the move, he took the gun out and fired. Two loud bangs were
heard and I fell on the tarmac with a “thud”. I couldn’t feel my body chest-down, two of the black-robed-men grabbed me from the
collar and dragged me to the nearest bench, their leader instructed them to leave me alone. I struggled to stand but stumbled on
the bench and sat on it. The leader came near me and took off his mask. “ Oh..no it can’t be you...no it can’t be..”I looked
down and saw there were no wounds!, except a few scratches from the humiliating fall. “Happy birthday brother” he said. After
all, it was one of my brother’s pranks, he always likes to humiliate me.
